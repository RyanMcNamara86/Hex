# Hex

This project is essentially an implementation of the hexagonal tiling math and
algorithms presented on https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/. I highly
recommend referencing it for more information about how a function works or why
it's needed (as well as for the interactive diagrams and such).
